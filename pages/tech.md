## History
It's impossible to mark down all of the history associated with publishers' bindings in such a small exhibition, but this section serves to very briefly point out some of the biggest advancements made in the book indstry that contributed to the production of publishers' bindings!

### 1820s-1830s
The rise of mechanization means that books can be made much faster and in much larger quantities! As a result, books could be prefabricated and mass produced, and the publishers' binding was born. Along with this, people in England figured out how to adapt iron printing presses to decorate bindings and stamp or emboss them in a single impression! A major improvement over previous printing methods. First created in England in 1832 and then in use in the United States by 1834.[^1]

### 1831
Gold-blocking on cloth is now possible. Originally it was just for decorating the spine, but then eventually for covers as well. From here there's a bunch of artistics experimentation.[^2]

### 1850s
This decade saw the rise of steam-powered cloth-stamping presses, made the process go much faster.[^3]

### 1870s
A time of reinvention for book cover art. For American bindings painters, architects, and even stained glass designers were hired by various publishing companies to create new designs.[^4] 

### 1894
Common for American binding designers to sign their work. From here through the early 1900s known designers are used and identifiable.[^5]

### 1910
Rise of book jackets - there’s so much room for advertising! From here on out there's a decline in the production of publishers' bindings.[^6]

### 1930
This is effectively the end of decorated cloth bindings. Dust jackets have become standard for hardcover books and there's an increase in paperback publishing. In the United States, the Great Depression looms and makes the extra expense unsustainable as well. [^7]

## Techniques
The effort that went into creating decorated cloth bindings was no small feat, and the specifics of their production are an incredibly interesting facet of this history. The definitions below cover a handful of essential materials, tools, and techniques that were utilized. All definitions come from the second edition of Geoffry Glaister's Encyclopedia of the Book, and their page numbers are denoted in linked footnotes. 

### Blind Blocking
The impression of lettering or a design onto a binding, made by machine. Blind blocking is specifically the use of blocking without gold leaf.[^8]

### Block
A metal stamp used to impress lettering or a design onto a binding. In the case of publisher's bindings, they were normally made of brass.[^9]

### Blocking Press
A press that used heated blocks to stamp lettering and designs onto a binding. Can be used for blind or gold blocking.[^10]

### Book cloth
Book cloth is dyed and coated calico made to be hardwearing, water-resistant, and capable of being blocked with lettering or designs. The first official book cloth was created in England in 1825, which quickly gained traction through the early 19th century. The first book bound in cloth in the United States was produced shortly after its introduction, in 1827. By 1840, book cloth was incredibly viable production-wise, and so there was a dramatic uptick in books bound in cloth (publishers' bindings!). Modern book cloth utilizes different materials and coatings.[^11]

### Die
A specially engraved intaglio stamp for impressing lettering or a design onto a binding.[^12]

### Edition Binding
Another word for publishers' or decorated cloth bindings. These types of bindings were machine made and mass produced.[^13]

### Gold Blocking 
Once a binding has first been marked or blind tooled/stamped, it was then coated in glair, laid with gold leaf, and stamped using heated dies or blocks in a blocking press. This impression permanently affixed the gold leaf to the intended design. The finished gold design is also known as gilt.[^14] 

### Gold Blocking Press
A special press that used heated blocks for impressing lettering or a design in gilt onto a binding.[^15]

### Gold Leaf
The traditional material used for gilding, spine lettering, or other designs. It's still used today! The gold leaf used tends to be 4 millionths of an inch.[^16]

### Glair
An adhesive of egg whites and vinegar put on book covers before blocking or tooling with gold leaf, which makes it stick permanently when a heated tool or die is used for the impression.[^17]
