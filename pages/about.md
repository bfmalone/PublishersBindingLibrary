## About the Library

This is a digital library containing various examples of decorated publishers' bindings from the 19th to 20th centuries. After the invention of various machines to assist in and speed up the production of books in the modern era, publishers jumped at the change to create mass-produced bindings for their books. The materials, types, artists, and techniques used for the creation of these bindings is an intriguing area of study which is explored briefly in this digital collection.
